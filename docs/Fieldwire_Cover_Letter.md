Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Android Engineer position at **Fieldwire**. With more than a decade of hands-on experience in mobile and full-stack development, I have delivered complex, high-reliability applications for enterprises, government institutes, and independent ventures. I am drawn to Fieldwire’s mission to revolutionize construction management with technology, and I believe my background in building robust, user-focused systems aligns closely with your needs.

In my previous role as Lead Android Developer at Negasht-e Andishe Sabz, I designed and implemented enterprise apps used by major companies such as Pars Hayan, Iran AvandFar, and the Seed and Plant Certification and Registration Institute (SPCRI). One highlight was developing a **dynamic form engine** that allowed hundreds of agricultural registration forms to be created and updated without changing the APK — a feature still in use today. I also engineered a **background tracking system** that reliably captured employee location data, overcoming Android’s restrictions and power management challenges. These experiences sharpened my ability to solve complex technical problems in production environments.

More recently, I built and currently operate a **commercial VPN service** with over 100 active users. This required designing a secure infrastructure with XRAY and Psiphon servers, building a Node.js + TypeScript backend, and creating a polished web-based admin panel for user management and quota tracking. I engineered stealth routing techniques to make VPN traffic indistinguishable from normal browsing, demonstrating my ability to innovate under constraints and deliver production-ready solutions quickly.

What excites me about Fieldwire is the opportunity to apply this mix of **deep Android expertise** and **end-to-end product development experience** to a platform that is directly transforming an essential global industry. My strengths lie in:  

- Building **robust, scalable Android applications** using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and MVVM.  
- Designing for **real-world reliability**, where downtime or errors are unacceptable.  
- Collaborating across backend and frontend to ensure **seamless user experiences**.  

I am enthusiastic about the chance to contribute to Fieldwire’s engineering team and to help shape tools that empower construction professionals worldwide. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and background can support your mission.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Fieldwire’s success.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
