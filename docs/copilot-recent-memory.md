Branch: feature/LWB-55-room-and-periodic-sync (local active)

Completed (server):
- LWB-51: Signed manifest builder (checksum + HMAC) implemented; optional manifest returned by /v1/ingest/docx when MANIFEST_SECRET is set.
- LWB-52: Sanitized output shape verified; ingestion parsing uses sanitize-html; tests green.
- Tests: 11/11 passing (vitest).

Notable stubs/placeholders (outside 51/52 scope):
- /v1/articles/manifest returns static sample items (placeholder endpoint).
- In ingestion response, manifest uses id/title "upload" for now (placeholder identifiers; no persistence yet).

Notes:
- No TODO/FIXME markers in server/src related to LWB-46/51/52.
- MANIFEST_SECRET gates manifest emission by design.

Recent:
- LWB-48: Implemented and deployed with Postgres; endpoints for manifest and article details. PR #14 green after lint fixes.
- LWB-53: feature/LWB-53-client-sync branch open (PR #15). Android repo implements delta fetch, tests passing.
- LWB-54/57/58: Implemented retry with backoff, checksum validation, and version-aware delta; merged via PR #16. Local cleanup done (deleted feature/LWB-54-delta-sync; also deleted stale feature/LWB-48-persist). Main fast-forwarded.
- LWB-55: Room DAO extended for media assets; repository persists and prunes assets in sync.
- LWB-59: WorkManager periodic sync added (EntryPoint injection); scheduled from Application on startup; unit test uses Robolectric runner.

Next:
- Run full unit tests (done; green) and open PR for feature/LWB-55-room-and-periodic-sync covering LWB-55 and LWB-59.
- After merge: consider instrumentation test for WorkManager schedule and asset UI wiring.
