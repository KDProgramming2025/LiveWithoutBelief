I’m building a real Android app called “Live Without Belief.” It explores the scientific inconsistencies in religious texts like the Quran and Bible, offers secular guidance for living without belief, and imagines a better future without religion. 

Teach me everything step-by-step, no outside links, no skipping. Assume I want to publish this app on Google Play. 
Ask me questions to clarify everything, don't presume anything.

kinds of content the app will display:

- Static text articles( in .docx format)
- Media (images, audio, video)
- Search, filtering, or bookmarking


For commenting and creating bookmarks etc users need to create an account, but the login should be with google account and fast and simple. They should be able to login without entering any text. just a login button.

I might add multi-language functionality later.
It should have both light and dark theme.

I want to write my articles and content in word documents on windows and use them. they have stylings in them with pictures and bullet points etc. The app should be able to show them properly with pagination and comfortable reading and marking and commenting and discussion on the selected word or sentence or image, I will answer these on my linux server via a web ui. each discussion is unique to the user creating it, others won't be able to see them. The chat page for it should be able to add attachments and images and links.
The content will be fetched from the server, so it should check if the file has changed and redownload it.


Also I want to create this app with the latest technologies and best practices currently being used by medium to large companies, I want to use all the tools and workflows. Github, Jira, CI/CD, TDD, MVVM, etc. It will be open source so that I can include it in my resume for the companies so that I can get hired in advanced countries.

Search the web and update your info about everything related to Android Development, TDD on Android, CI/CD for Android, Jira for Android, Github for Android, Android Studio, Firebase for Android, Kotlin for Android, Jetpack for Android, Dependency injection for Android, and everything related to professional android development. The information you seek should not be older than 6 months. After that always remember what you have learned and keep in mind for every response in the future.

We will do this exactly how the medium companies do in real world. Include all and everything that's needed to be done in the real world. Even if it's just signing up in a website you should include that as a step. Don't bloat the response with multiple steps, only one single step at a time.
For CI/CD and project management I want to use  Jira+Github+Gitlab.

Project's Jira setup is in docs\backlog-moscow-jira.json, this file is not for import to Jira. It's only for reference.
Github CLI and Gitlab CLI are installed and GITHUB_TOKEN and GITLAB_TOKEN are set.

Github CI workflow is set up in .github/workflows/android.yml
Gitlab CI workflow is set up in .gitlab-ci.yml
